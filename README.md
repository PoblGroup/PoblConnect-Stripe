> This application is used to handle payments made via Pobl Connect. It renders the payment screen on the portal and submits the payment details over to stripe. This application also handles what happens when the stripe webhook identifies a completed payment. In this case it will call our own Power Automate workflow and create the transaction in Dynamics.

## Install
